With the Siri watch face on, you can raise your wrist throughout the day to receive dynamic information, such as traffic information if you&#8217;re about to leave work and sunset times in the evening.<\/p>\n<p>Apple also announced a couple of fun watch faces, including a &#8220;Kaleidoscope&#8221; face &#8220;Mickey&#8221; and &#8220;Minnie Mouse&#8221; faces were some of the most popular.<\/p>\n<h2>What&#8217;s new in iOS 11?<\/h2>\n<p>As expected, Apple revealed new iOS 11 to developers during the WWDC keynote. While it is still in beta phase, it showed a sneak peak of new features, so developers can start building their app before it is released for public.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the some of the updates for iOS 11 users.<\/p>\n<h3>Customizable Control Center<\/h3>\n<p>One of the awesome feature of Android which iPhone users missed for years, is the ability to on\/off features right from the home page.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you want to enable your mobile data, in iOS you had to open Settings app to toggle on or off. Now with the new iOS 11, they can now customize the controls on notification center.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/stacktips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/iOS11-Control-Center.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/stacktips.com\/wp-content\/themes\/stacktips\/img\/1x1.trans.gif\" data-lazy-src=\"http:\/\/stacktips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/iOS11-Control-Center.jpg\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-12780 size-full\" alt=\"iOS11 Control Center\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" srcset=\"http:\/\/stacktips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/iOS11-Control-Center.jpg 800w, http:\/\/stacktips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/iOS11-Control-Center-620x414.jpg 620w, http:\/\/stacktips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/iOS11-Control-Center-720x481.jpg 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"><noscript><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-12780 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/stacktips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/iOS11-Control-Center.jpg\" alt=\"iOS11 Control Center\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" srcset=\"http:\/\/stacktips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/iOS11-Control-Center.jpg 800w, http:\/\/stacktips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/iOS11-Control-Center-620x414.jpg 620w, http:\/\/stacktips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/iOS11-Control-Center-720x481.jpg 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/noscript><\/a><\/p>\n<p>New iOS 11 brings brand new and customizable control center. Now can add more shortcuts to control center by visiting Settings-&gt;Control center settings.<\/p>\n<p>Uninstalling of unused apps: There is a potions in settings app, which will automatically uninstall the app which haven&#8217;t been used for a while. Though the document and data for these uninstalled apps will remain in the memory in case the app is again reinstalled.<\/p>\n<h3>New notification center<\/h3>\n<p>The notification center screen UI is refreshed. It will now display all the current notifications for the day and all other older notification will be pushed to the bottom.<\/p>\n<h3>Safari updates<\/h3>\n<p>Safari browser is now faster and sleeker. Users now have an option to block the annoying Auto-Play videos in browser.<\/p>\n<h3>Password autofill and sharing<\/h3>\n<p>Logging into apps, as Apple notes, is a source of friction for many users. We\u2019re supposed to use complex passwords, change them frequently and not store them in unsecured places \u2014 like an Excel spreadsheet or note, for example. But it\u2019s also difficult to remember which passwords we need to gain access to which resources if we don\u2019t write them down somewhere.<\/p>\n<p>Your password can be shared quickly with and device running iOS 11.<\/p>\n<h3>App Store<\/h3>\n<p>The iOS 11 features a redesigned App Store. Now it categorizes games and apps into separate sections. In additions to games and apps section,\u00a0a new tab called &#8220;Today&#8221; features to display App of the Day and a Game of the Day. Editor&#8217;s picks are also displayed Today section.<\/p>\n<p>As for the individual pages of the apps, Apple has chosen to highlight reviews, placing more emphasis on Editor&#8217;s Choice for instance. A preview of the content can now be seen in multiple videos displayed on the page.<\/p>\n<p>With the revamped App Store, users are now notified whenever developers launch new features for their favorite apps.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/stacktips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/New-App-Store-iOS11.png\"><img src=\"http:\/\/stacktips.com\/wp-content\/themes\/stacktips\/img\/1x1.trans.gif\" data-lazy-src=\"http:\/\/stacktips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/New-App-Store-iOS11.png\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-12795 size-full\" alt=\"New App Store iOS11\" width=\"858\" height=\"447\" srcset=\"http:\/\/stacktips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/New-App-Store-iOS11.png 858w, http:\/\/stacktips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/New-App-Store-iOS11-620x323.png 620w, http:\/\/stacktips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/New-App-Store-iOS11-720x375.png 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 858px) 100vw, 858px\"><noscript><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-12795 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/stacktips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/New-App-Store-iOS11.png\" alt=\"New App Store iOS11\" width=\"858\" height=\"447\" srcset=\"http:\/\/stacktips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/New-App-Store-iOS11.png 858w, http:\/\/stacktips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/New-App-Store-iOS11-620x323.png 620w, http:\/\/stacktips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/New-App-Store-iOS11-720x375.png 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 858px) 100vw, 858px\" \/><\/noscript><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Screen recording<\/h3>\n<p>iOS 11 brings screen recording inbuilt with the phone. Now you can record your phone screen while doing other thing. \u00a0This is amazing specially for developers to record and report bugs.<\/p>\n<h3>One Hand Keyboard<\/h3>\n<p>This is by far one of my favourite updates. Specially for people do lot of typing in one had while traveling in tube, it is often very difficult with plus sized iPhone. Now with iOS 11 one handed keyboard, you can change the one handed mode to compress keyboard to side to make one handed typing.<\/p>\n<h3>Activity &amp; Workout App<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Monthly goals customized for user capabilities. Improved animations on achievements.<\/li>\n<li>Now multiple workouts can be tracked and updates in a single session. ex: walk+cycle+swim.<\/li>\n<li>Tie up with gyms to enable data exchange between recordings in Gym equipment and watch.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Apple Pay<\/h3>\n<p>Introduced person to person payment. This option is available form messages app. Just swipe in from bottom and scroll through the pay app.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/stacktips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Apple-Pay-iOS11.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/stacktips.com\/wp-content\/themes\/stacktips\/img\/1x1.trans.gif\" data-lazy-src=\"http:\/\/stacktips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Apple-Pay-iOS11-940x530.jpg\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-12787 size-large\" alt=\"Apple Pay iOS11\" width=\"900\" height=\"507\" srcset=\"http:\/\/stacktips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Apple-Pay-iOS11-940x530.jpg 940w, http:\/\/stacktips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Apple-Pay-iOS11-620x350.jpg 620w, http:\/\/stacktips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Apple-Pay-iOS11-980x553.jpg 980w, http:\/\/stacktips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Apple-Pay-iOS11-720x406.jpg 720w, http:\/\/stacktips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Apple-Pay-iOS11.jpg 1142w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\"><noscript><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-12787 size-large\" src=\"http:\/\/stacktips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Apple-Pay-iOS11-940x530.jpg\" alt=\"Apple Pay iOS11\" width=\"900\" height=\"507\" srcset=\"http:\/\/stacktips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Apple-Pay-iOS11-940x530.jpg 940w, http:\/\/stacktips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Apple-Pay-iOS11-620x350.jpg 620w, http:\/\/stacktips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Apple-Pay-iOS11-980x553.jpg 980w, http:\/\/stacktips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Apple-Pay-iOS11-720x406.jpg 720w, http:\/\/stacktips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Apple-Pay-iOS11.jpg 1142w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/noscript><\/a><br \/>\nThe received payment goes to your apple pay account card balance. You can either withdraw to your bank or use the credit for other purchases via Apple pay.<\/p>\n<h3>Intelligent Driving Mode<\/h3>\n<p>Do Not Disturb While Driving is a fantastic idea, which will understand if you\u2019re connected to a car, and automatically activate it while driving. It blacks out your screen to prevent you seeing useless notifications while driving, and will auto-reply to texts with a message saying you\u2019re in the car.<\/p>\n<h3>File Manager App<\/h3>\n<p>iPhone was very frustrating when it comes to its restricted file management as compared to its rival Android. But with iOS 11, Apple breaks the silence and added a new &#8220;File Manager&#8221; app to default system app category.<\/p>\n<p>It also has the ability to browse, manage and merge all data saved by the owner across several cloud-saving platforms.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/stacktips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/File-Manager-iOS11.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/stacktips.com\/wp-content\/themes\/stacktips\/img\/1x1.trans.gif\" data-lazy-src=\"http:\/\/stacktips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/File-Manager-iOS11.jpg\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-12804 size-full\" alt=\"File Manager iOS11\" width=\"680\" height=\"357\" srcset=\"http:\/\/stacktips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/File-Manager-iOS11.jpg 680w, http:\/\/stacktips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/File-Manager-iOS11-620x326.jpg 620w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><noscript><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-12804 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/stacktips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/File-Manager-iOS11.jpg\" alt=\"File Manager iOS11\" width=\"680\" height=\"357\" srcset=\"http:\/\/stacktips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/File-Manager-iOS11.jpg 680w, http:\/\/stacktips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/File-Manager-iOS11-620x326.jpg 620w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><\/noscript><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The app will allow users to organize files \u2014 including nested folders \u2014 that are locally stored on their devices or those that are saved on their iCloud Drive, Dropbox, Box, Google Drive and more. It also has the ability to gather saved searches, tags and the like from the said file-saving platforms.<\/p>\n<h2>What&#8217;s new for Developers?<\/h2>\n<p>Along side above visible features, Apple\u2019s annual developer conference added\u00a0brand new APIs and features for developers to explore.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apple promised the App Store review time will be much faster.<\/li>\n<li>Added ability for phased release. You can now release an update to some, measure effectiveness and server loads and then make it available to a larger group.<\/li>\n<li>Updates CoreML framework.\u00a0The software that powers Siri and all of Apple Machine learning capabilities.<\/li>\n<li>New APIs including vision &#8211; face detection, text, barcode, object tracking capabilities are now exposed for developers<\/li>\n<li>ARKit is added newly to the iOS family. This is indeed thrilling announcement for the Game developers.\u00a0Apps can add virtual objects to real environments and modify its properties. E.g\u00a0A virtual cup&#8217;s shadow can be played around with depending on the real object Lamp&#8217;s lighting.<\/li>\n<li>Wireless debugging &#8211; No need for cables to debug anymore. Isn&#8217;t it amazing?\u00a0\ud83d\udc4b<\/li>\n<li>Drag and Drop API,\u00a0to move around cells with all its content(as metadata) within the app as well as between apps.<\/li>\n<li>Main thread API checks for UI, which will be enabled by default. When UI related code is written in the background, Xcode throws errors.<\/li>\n<li>Videos+HTTP live streaming,\u00a0included their updated H.265 compression. Better compression and streaming, lesser storage space.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>XCode Updates<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Massive update for XCode 9. It is completely\u00a0re-written from scratch in Swift.<\/li>\n<li>Markdown Editors available<\/li>\n<li>Warnings will be made fully visible in screen, with &#8220;FIX-IT&#8221; inline<\/li>\n<li>Code structure highlighters<\/li>\n<li>Faster code refactoring, edits at project level made faster, smoother.

Crashlytics and Answers tool kits are recognized as the #1 SDKs for app stability and analytics.<\/p>\n<p>Fabric is now acquired by Google and the team will join the Google&#8217;s Developer Products Group, working with the Firebase team.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>When we look at Fabric, we see it as a great opportunity to bring together two amazing developer platforms, to really have the best of breeds,&#8221; said Jason Titus, vice president of Google\u2019s Developer Product Group.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Google is batting big on Firebase to make it an unified platform that helps developers to build apps faster without having to worry about some of the underlying complexities. Now with the inclusion of Fabric, Firebase may ditch its own crash reporting tools and will adopt Fabric &#8220;Crashlytics&#8221; as main tool for reporting app crashes.<\/p>\n<p>This acquisition however will not impact anything for the existing Fabric customers. But we believe, over the time, Google will unify the Fabric integration with Firebase SDK. This means developers do not have to integrate two different SDK&#8217;s to get Firebase and Fabric.<\/p>\n<p>The company also mentioned that, the Digits will continue to be maintained by Twitter under its existing terms.

As an experimental feature, Google released a new feature to download website for offline use for Android Chrome users. This feature is available from Android Chrome version 55 and above. If you have installed the older version of chrome, you can update it from Google Play.<\/p>\n<h2>How to Save Webpages in Android Chrome?<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update Android Chrome browser to at least version 55.<\/li>\n<li>Open the webpage you want to save<\/li>\n<li>After the page is loaded, tap on the options menu (flanked by 3 dots on the top right) and click download button to save page for offline viewing.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As the download completes, the website will be marked as available offline as depicted in the above picture. You will be able to download HTML5 videos or audio this way as long as the website has no custom controls or it is a live stream.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"entry-title\">Should Pocket and Instapaper Worry?<\/h2>\n<p>Pocket and Instapaper are the only two serious &#8220;Read it later&#8221; services available in market. They allow you to save articles and videos from desktop browsers\u00a0or mobile apps. Once the link is saved, it automatically syncs the content to your phone, tablet, and desktop applications.\u00a0Both the apps brings tons of distinct feature that makes them unique in market. Along with bookmarking webpage, it also offers smarter way to organize, manage and search your saved links.<\/p>\n<p>Here are of some of the reasons why you should consider using Read it later services over\u00a0Android Chrome &#8220;save for later&#8221; feature.<\/p>\n<div class=\"fancy-list\">\n<ul>\n<li>Google Android downloads the entire webpage and render as is for reading offline.
